# College Admissions Calculator
This project was developed as part of Assignment 4 in the Web Programming course at the Academic College of Tel Aviv-Yafo. The application is a tool for calculating university admission eligibility and scholarships based on user input.

* Responsive Logic: Automatically enables or disables specific input fields to prevent incorrect data entry.

## Technologies Used
* HTML5: Structure of the admission form and input controls.
